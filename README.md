# Challenge 1: Code refractor = Horiseon

## On-the-job ticket

Horiseon came to me with their current website code, asking me to update their code to follow accessibility standards so that the new website will be optimized for search engines.

### User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Issues identified and corrected

Most of the issues I was faced with was updating the HTML structure to a more semantic code structure and how much of an abundance of class selectors were used in the CSS file. I competed my task by reorganising the index.html file into the correct semantic structure and by adding more user-friendly element selectors into the CSS code.

## Future work

CSS:
- Use of a media screen
-: root to change entire selectors if necessary

I have added into HTML alt: notes and into CSS also /*notes*/ to help any future edits by making it easier to see what the different elements are in the code and if any collaboration work will be done in the future.
